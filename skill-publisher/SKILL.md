<essential_principles>
Publishing a skill involves three stages: preparation, GitHub release, and npm distribution. Each stage has specific requirements and validation steps. Always verify the skill structure before publishing.
</essential_principles>

What would you like to do?

1. **Publish new skill** - First-time publish to GitHub and npm
2. **Update existing skill** - Release new version
3. **Check publish readiness** - Validate skill structure
4. **Test installation** - Verify npx and skills CLI work

<commentary>
Wait for user response. Common variations:
- "publish my skill" → Option 1
- "release new version" → Option 2  
- "is my skill ready" → Option 3
- "test if it works" → Option 4
