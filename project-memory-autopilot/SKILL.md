# Project Memory Autopilot

Implement external memory as first-class project infrastructure, not ad-hoc notes.

## Workflow

1. Determine runtime target.
   - `codex` -> `.codex/memory/`
   - `claude` -> `.claude/memory/`
   - `opencode` -> `.opencode/memory/`
   - fallback -> `.ai/memory/`
2. Inspect existing routing/protocol files.
   - Common locations: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/guides/protocol-*.md`, local collaboration skill files.
3. Bootstrap memory storage.
   - Prefer script:
     `python scripts/bootstrap_memory.py --root <repo> --runtime <codex|claude|opencode|generic>`
   - Use `--dry-run` first, then run without it.
4. Wire memory rules into protocol docs.
   - Read memory files at non-trivial task start.
   - Define hard/soft write triggers.
   - Require final report line:
     `Memory Update: written|skipped + files + trigger`
5. Seed initial memory entries.
   - User preferences and communication constraints.
   - Active context and next priorities.
   - Decision log entry for the current change.
6. Validate before completion.
   - Memory files exist.
   - Protocol docs reference the memory path and trigger behavior.
   - Final report format includes the memory update line.

## Trigger Matrix

Read `references/memory-trigger-matrix.md` and apply:
- hard trigger: any 1 -> write memory
- soft trigger: any 2 -> write memory

## Templates

Use assets as copy-ready templates:
- `assets/user-profile.template.md`
- `assets/active-context.template.md`
- `assets/decision-log.template.jsonl`
- `assets/agents-memory-block.template.md`
- `assets/protocol-memory-block.template.md`

## Implementation Notes

- Keep memory updates minimal and append-only where possible.
- Store durable preferences in `user-profile.md`.
- Store short-lived execution state in `active-context.md`.
- Append key decisions to `decision-log.jsonl`; do not rewrite history.
